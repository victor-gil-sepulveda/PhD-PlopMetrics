PLOP / PELE metrics extraction
==============================

The old version of PELE (J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2012, 8 (3), pp 959â€“965) stores the computed metrics of each frame (e.g. rmsd, ligand binding energy...) as remarks before each *MODEL* tag.  

This is a toolkit that helps to parse the trajectories generated in this way and to extract the value of these metrics in order to eventually plot them.
